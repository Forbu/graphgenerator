Module with the GraphGAN class

The graphGAN is a generative adversarial network
that is composed of a generator and a discriminator.

- The generator takes a latent representation as input
and outputs a graph.

- The discriminator takes a graph as input
and outputs a probability distribution over the real and fake graphs.
